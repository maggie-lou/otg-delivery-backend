# otg-delivery-backend

This project is a Node.js server that functions as the backend for an on-the-go delivery iOS application. Uses MongoDB for database, and our instance is hosted on mlab (ping me on Slack for access). The server itself is hosted on Heroku (http://otg-delivery.herokuapp.com/api/ being the base endpoint).

# Commands
To run production server locally: `npm start`

To run development server locally: `npm dev`

To run all tests: `npm test`

To populate item and location data: `node scripts/populate_data`
